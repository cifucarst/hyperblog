# Hyperblog ðŸ’š
Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share with you my journey learning about Git and GitHub. I started out with the basics, learning the commands for creating and managing repositories. I then moved on to more advanced topics, such as branching and merging, and using pull requests. I also learned how to use GitHub to collaborate with others on projects.

##In this course I have the opportunity
In addition to learning about Git and GitHub, I also implemented an *HTML* and *CSS* project. This project gave me the opportunity to put my new skills to the test. I'm proud to say that I was able to create a beautiful and functional blog using *HTML* and *CSS.*

I hope you enjoy reading my blog and learning about my journey with Git, GitHub and web development.

This is just the beginnig....:tw-1f680:
